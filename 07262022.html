    <h1>July 26, 2022</h1>
    <p2>
      Today was a Tuesday. I got up at 7:45 so I could make lunch and a smoothie
      and be out the door by 8:10. That didn't happen but I made it out at 8:15.
      My smoothie was a little bland. It could have used some yogurt but all the
      yogurt in our fridge is expired. I'm not going to be the one to throw it
      out though, that just feels wrong. <br /><br />At work I tried to make
      measurements with the buffer but the measurements seemed off so I waited
      for Jason to help. When he came to help later, he said I was doing it
      right so me and Andrew took all the measurements for that. I also worked a
      little on writing a class that Jason was telling me about. It's supposed
      to do the same thing that our Lockin Alignment script does but more
      general and with Matlab timers. Speaking of timers, we spent about 3 hours
      trying to solve an error with a timer that we were having and it was as
      simple as making the timer callback functions local. How dumb is that?
      Jason also mentioned lambda calculus today which I don't actually know how
      to do but I know I'll learn it next semester so that's kinda sick.<br /><br />
      I left at 5 to get to church and I did alot of productive things while
      driving. I ate mozzerella cheese and subsequently spilled cheese juice all
      over the car. Then I ate peanuts and for some reason they were greasy so I
      got peanut oil on the steering wheel and my clothes. I also changed into
      my VBS shirt while at a stoplight. Overall, more productive than I usually
      am while driving. I changed into shorts when I got into the church parking
      lot. That was a bit harder to do while driving. <br /><br />VBS pretty
      much went by without a hitch. No kids were lost like last night and it
      went pretty smoothly. I do think I've used all my brain power by the end
      of the night because I couldn't figure out how to read the sign out sheets
      when the parents came to pick up their kids. <br /><br />At home I tried
      on my new jeans again. I can't wait until it gets cold enough to wear
      them, they're so cool. I guess that's the end of my mundane day. The rest
      of this week should look pretty similar. There's not much time for
      anything else when I'm out for 13 hours and sleep for 9. Just about enough
      time to write this blog post and eat dinner. Tomorrow I foresee a slight
      deviation from the norm though. Stay tuned, and sleep well.
